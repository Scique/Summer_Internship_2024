    "\t- Yes: Move onto next step\n",
    "\t- No: Scan next image/stop program if no more images\n",
    "3. Use OCR(optical character recognition) to analyze the text in the images - analyze in English and Thai\n",
    "4. Get the position of the text where it says something like \"siganture\" or \"name\" or \"first name\" or \"last name\" or \"surname\" \n",
    "5. Create variations of the documents with each possible place for the signature marked with a bounding box\n",
    "6. Send into GPT and have it check if the box marked is really the signature field\n",
    "\t- For the ones that are, save the coords of those boxes and then combine it all back into one image. \n",
